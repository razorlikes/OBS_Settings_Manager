# OBS Settings Manager
"OBS Settings Manager" lets you backup your OBS Studio profiles and manage them in an easy, user friendly way.

## What can it do?
For now I have only implemented the core features but I have plans for quite a bit more!

__Right now you can:__
* Backup your profiles and add additional information
* Restore your profiles from backups
* See detailed settings of your backups

__In the future you will be able to:__
* Export/Import backups and share them with others
* Compare backups to your current settings
* Link recorded videos to your backups
* ...and more!
